basicly the program depend on id to can answer, you should show the questions that sent to you as it will not appear automatically.
used file base system.


**Keep warning!**

Basicly there is no data so try to insert some of it then try.


**How to ask question ?** 


you can do that by show id of all Users first from *list system user* then choose *Ask question*.

**How to answer ?**

steps Like ask question except that you will chose *Answer Question*.

**NOTE**

-The project still need alot of exceptions handling. (sorry for that)
-Username consist from one string with no spaces.
-Try system from diff. account to can understand how system work.
